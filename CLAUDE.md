# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a PHP playground repository for experimenting with PHP code and concepts.

## Development Setup

Since this is a minimal playground setup, PHP files can be run directly:

```bash
# Run a PHP file
php filename.php

# Start PHP built-in server (if creating web examples)
php -S localhost:8000

# Check PHP version
php --version
```

## Architecture

This is a simple playground structure where PHP scripts can be created and executed directly. No specific framework or structure is enforced.
